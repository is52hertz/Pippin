# Create Pippin's long-lived local code-signing identity. Run once per machine.
#
# Why this matters more than it looks: macOS keys TCC grants (Automation, Full
# Disk Access, Reminders) to the code signature. Replacing the certificate does
# not produce an error — it silently invalidates every permission the user has
# granted, and the app starts failing in ways that look like bugs. So this script
# refuses to touch an existing identity, and there is deliberately no --force.
#
# Self-signed only. There is no paid Apple Developer account behind this project
# (parent decision O2), so Developer ID and notarization are permanently out of
# reach. Signing branches for them are not merely unused here, they are a live
# footgun, so they are absent.
#
# Secrets policy: this script exports nothing. Private key material exists only
# inside a mode-0700 temporary directory under $TMPDIR — never inside the
# repository — and is wiped on exit, including on failure and interrupt. No
# .p12, .cer, or key file survives the run.
#
# macOS gives no way to do better than that. Verified, not assumed:
#   - certtool can generate a key pair directly inside the keychain with no file
#     at all, but its only Extended Key Usage option is "Any", and codesign then
#     rejects the result with "no identity found".
#   - `security import` cannot read a pipe ("Unable to decode the provided
#     data"); it needs a seekable file, so the PKCS#12 must briefly be one.
#   - `security add-trusted-cert` takes a certificate file, and without it the
#     identity stays CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED and codesign will not use it.
#
# Expect two macOS authorization prompts. They are inherent, not incidental:
# one grants codesign access to the new private key, one writes the trust
# setting. Approve both.
