## Session 1: Pippin planning: task tree, addendum integration, skeleton activation

**Date**: 2026-08-18
**Task**: Pippin planning: task tree, addendum integration, skeleton activation
**Branch**: `feat/pippin-skeleton-transport`

### Summary

Planned the Pippin macOS MCP server as a parent task plus three batch-one children, folded the side-session addendum (O1-O3 answers, Shortcuts module, roadmap) into the parent artifacts, activated the skeleton child, and recorded step-0 environment findings.

### Main Changes

- Initial repo commit: agent workflow scaffolding plus .gitignore
- Created parent 08-17-pippin-mcp-server and children skeleton-transport / reminders-crud / mail-read-search with full prd+design+implement artifacts
- Closed O1 (swift-sdk approved), O2 (free-tier self-signed identity), O3 (batch-one tools/list budget 4KB -> 6KB)
- Shortcuts elevated to a batch-two user-curated module; escape hatch dropped to batch three; Health (via Exporter) and remote-access token tiers recorded as positions 7 and 8
- Skeleton gained S9/AC11: token validation resolves to a capability set and the registry takes (Config, Capabilities), so batch-four token tiers need no rework
- Roadmap for batches 2-4 appended to parent prd; Screen Time scheduled early because knowledgeC.db has a ~4-week rolling window

### Git Commits

(No commits - planning session)

### Testing

- [OK] task.py validate passes on all four tasks
- [OK] Toolchain verified: macOS 26.5.1 / Xcode 26.5 / SDK 26.5 / Swift 6.3.2

### Status

[OK] **Completed**

### Next Steps

- Finish implement.md step 0: resolve swift-sdk version and confirm the API surface
- Stop condition: if the SDK exposes no per-request session id, revise confirm-token session binding in the parent design before writing tools
- Then step 1 (Package.swift skeleton) and step 2 (packaging + setup_dev_signing.sh, self-signed only) to reach gate G1


## Session 2: Pippin skeleton Step 8 native GUI

**Date**: 2026-08-23
**Task**: Pippin skeleton Step 8 native GUI
**Branch**: `feat/pippin-skeleton-transport`

### Summary

Implemented honest non-prompting permission reporting, native menu-bar and Settings UI, atomic config application, tests, signed-bundle runtime evidence, and independent Trellis review. Step 9 remains; final user visual confirmation is recorded as pending.

**Date**: 2026-08-24
**Task**: Pippin Step 8 permission onboarding
**Branch**: `feat/pippin-skeleton-transport`

### Summary

Separated passive permission status from explicit user actions, fixed LSUIElement Settings activation, added state-specific Reminders and Mail onboarding, verified 193 tests and the stable signed bundle, and recorded the remaining visual HIG debt.

**Task**: Pippin Step 8 HIG redesign and verification
**Branch**: `feat/pippin-skeleton-transport`

### Summary

Completed Step 8D with deterministic DEBUG previews, a fixed-ID standard Settings window, functional native sidebar toggle, signed-app manual HIG verification, durable frontend guidance, and explicit VoiceOver deferral. Skeleton task remains in progress for Step 9.
